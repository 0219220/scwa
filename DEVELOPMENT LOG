Project II: Blog 

Jorge Antonio Maldonado Núñez, Luis Fernando Villaseñor García, Isabella Rosa Bismanns

Thursday, October 21st: 
Luis started to set up the front end, this included choosing the theme(which was decided by everyone), color scheme, font sizes, and designing the general layout of the front end. 

Monday, October 25th: 
Jorge and Luis added the backend in the index file, this is where they designed the function. 

Tuesday, October 26th:
Luis, Jorge and Isabella implemented the node.js backend server.
On top of that, Isabella tried to upload the code on Heroku and fixed some front end errors. 
During the implementation of the express server we all went through problems, like for example for some reason only the html of the project was appearing in the live webpage. 
To end up, we adjusted missing things and resolved the last errors.
